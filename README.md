# PCB Designs with Altium Designer

This repository contains my recent PCB designs created using **Altium Designer**. These designs are part of my journey in embedded systems and circuit design, focusing on precision, efficiency, and robust electrical performance.

## Project Overview

### Key Designs:
1. **Power Supply Circuits**: Stable and reliable power delivery with filtering and decoupling.
2. **7-Segment Display Integration**: Efficient and clear display control.
3. **Arduino Nano (ATMEGA328P) Circuitry**: Core microcontroller design with essential components for embedded projects.
4. Various additional components supporting embedded systems.

## Features
- **Accurate Routing**: Optimized signal flow for minimal noise and interference.
- **Component Placement**: Designed for both manual assembly and automated PCB manufacturing.
- **Stable Power Supply**: Includes proper filtering and decoupling for clean power output.
- **Arduino Nano Support**: Circuitry based on the ATMEGA328P microcontroller.

## Repository Content
- **Schematics** (.SchDoc): Contains the schematic designs for each project.
- **PCB Layouts** (.PcbDoc): PCB layout files designed using Altium.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: List of components used in each design.
