# PCB Designs with Altium Designer

This repository contains my recent PCB designs created using Altium Designer. These designs are part of my journey in embedded systems and circuit design, focusing on precision, efficiency, and robust electrical performance.

## Project Overview

### Key Designs:
- **Power Supply Circuits**: Stable and reliable power delivery with filtering and decoupling.
- **7-Segment Display Integration**: Efficient and clear display control.
- Various additional components supporting embedded systems.

## Features
- **Accurate Routing**: Optimized signal flow for minimal noise and interference.
- **Component Placement**: Designed for both manual assembly and automated PCB manufacturing.
- **Stable Power Supply**: Includes proper filtering and decoupling for clean power output.

## Repository Content
- **Schematics (.SchDoc)**: Contains the schematic designs for each project.
- **PCB Layouts (.PcbDoc)**: PCB layout files designed using Altium.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: List of components used in each design.
